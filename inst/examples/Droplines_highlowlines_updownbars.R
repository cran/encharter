# Line chart with two series (Open, Close) showing the three optional adornments
# that the Chart class exposes as logical fields: drop_lines (vertical lines
# from points down to the X-axis), high_low_lines (vertical lines connecting
# the two series at each category) and up_down_bars (shaded bars between the
# two series). Most useful when comparing two paired series, e.g. for stock
# Open/Close behaviour. Chart at E2:M20.
